# SendToWebhook
C++ rewrite of [DiscordWebhookMessager](https://github.com/NeoInversion/DiscordWebhookMessager)

## About
This is a C++ rewrite of [DiscordWebhookMessager](https://github.com/NeoInversion/DiscordWebhookMessager) which currently has little additional functionality. The project is planned to have a GUI and much more customization, but at the time of writing I'm overwhelmed with other tasks.

Notice: Commit history is shorter than it should be because the original repository was deleted. This is because of some problems I ran into while committing changes, which ended up resulting in me deleting the old repository and creating this one.

## Dependencies
If builing from source, you will need [nlohmann's JSON library](https://github.com/nlohmann/json) and [whoshuu's C++ requests](https://github.com/whoshuu/cpr).
